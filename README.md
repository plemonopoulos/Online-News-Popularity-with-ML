# Online-News-Popularity-with-ML
In this Project we use machine learning algorithms to determine how popular an article will be before it is published. We use regression methods to predict the number of shares of articles and classification to predict whether an article will be popular.
We approach this task in regression and classification. 
In regression, we try to predict the exact number of times an article will be shared. 
In classification, we try to predict whether an article will be popular, where a popular article is one that has been shared more than a chosen threshold.
Regression methods: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
Classification methods: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, K Nearest Neighbors
